The Zonkey Pipeline is a easy-to-use pipeline designed for the analyses of low-coverage, ancient DNA derived from historical equid samples, with the purpose of determining the species of the sample, as well as determining possible hybridization between horses, zebras, and asses (see :ref:`zonkey_usage`).

This is accomplished by comparing one or more samples aligned against the *Equus caballus* 2.0 reference sequence with a reference panel of modern equids, including wild and domesticated equids. The reference panel is further described in the :ref:`zonkey_panel` section.
