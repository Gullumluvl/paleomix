Regions of interest may span anything from a few short genomic regions, to the complete exome of complex organisms (tens of thousands of genes), and entire genomes.

Following genotyping, multiple sequence alignment may optionally be carried out (this is required if indels were called), and phylogenetic inference may be done one the complete set of regions, or a subset of regions, using a supermatrix approach using ExaML.
