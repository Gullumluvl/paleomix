Other tools
===========

On top of the pipelines described in the major sections of the documentation, the pipeline comes bundled with several other, smaller tools, all accessible via the 'paleomix' command. These tools are (briefly) described in this section.


paleomix coverage
-----------------

Calculates coverage for a BAM file, either for the entire genome or for specific regions.


paleomix depths
---------------

Calculates a depth histogram for a BAM file, either for the entire genome or for specific regions.


paleomix rmdup_collapsed
------------------------

Filters PCR duplicates for merged/collapsed paired-ended reads, such as those generated by AdapterRemoval with the --collapse option enabled.


paleomix gtf_to_bed
-------------------

Convert GTF file to BED files grouped by feature (coding, RNA, etc).


paleomix vcf_filter
-------------------

Quality filters for VCF records, similar to 'vcfutils.pl varFilter'.


paleomix vcf_to_fasta
---------------------

The 'paleomix vcf\_to\_fasta' command is used to generate FASTA sequences from a VCF file, based either on a set of BED coordinates provided by the user, or for the entire genome covered by the VCF file. By default, heterzyous SNPs are represented using IUPAC codes.
